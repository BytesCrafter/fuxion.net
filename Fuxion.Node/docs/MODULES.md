# Fuxion Server Modules

This repository contains a real-time server system composed of several modules that cater to different communication and interaction needs. Each module serves a specific purpose within the server architecture, enabling real-time communication and coordination.

## Modules Overview

1. **Master Module:**
   The master module acts as the central control and communication hub for all other modules within the server. It manages coordination, configuration, and control of the server's components. The master module facilitates efficient communication between different components.

2. **Chat Module:**
   The chat module facilitates real-time text-based communication between clients. It manages message routing, storage, and delivery, allowing users to exchange messages instantly. This module is suitable for building chat applications.

3. **Voice Module:**
   The voice module handles real-time voice communication between clients. It encodes, transmits, and decodes audio to enable seamless voice communication. This module is essential for applications such as online gaming and video conferencing.

4. **World Module:**
   The world module manages persistent world data and updates shared among clients. It ensures that clients have a synchronized view of a virtual environment or state. Access to updating persistent data may be restricted to specific client groups for control and consistency.

5. **Game Module:**
   The game module handles real-time updates specific to a game scenario. It manages dynamic game elements like player positions, object interactions, scores, etc. Updates are efficiently sent to all clients, specific clients, or groups participating in a game session.

6. **Auto Module (Home and Enterprise Automation):**
   The auto module integrates Internet of Things (IoT) devices for home and enterprise automation. It facilitates real-time communication between the server and IoT devices, enabling remote control and monitoring of connected devices. This module bridges the gap between digital control systems and physical devices.

## Usage

Each module is designed to be modular and can be integrated based on the specific requirements of your application. You can customize and extend these modules to create a comprehensive real-time server system that meets your project's needs.
